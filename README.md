payforpredictions
=================

A friend, Pablo Suarez, is running a competition to determine the best strategy
for winning in game called ["Pay for predictions"][PFP]. Our goal is to openly
and collaboratively help him, by providing some winning strategies for the game.
So spread the word! The game intends to capture real life situations faced by the Red Cross Red
Crescent when dealing with natural disasters (e.g., flooding, earthquakes,
etc.,.). 

Here is the web rendering of the ipython notebook and it's slideshow:
